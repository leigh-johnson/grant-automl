The Trust provides grants to researchers in the states of Washington, Oregon, Alaska or Idaho and in British Columbia. Because the Arc Trust Fund is small compared to public funding sources, preference is given to junior investigators. Research grants should serve as seed money for future research. Most successful applicants have been affiliated with research universities and have addressed educational, medical, or psychological issues, but the Arc welcomes innovative proposals from any applicant on any topic related to its purposes.
