"New Idea Award Objectives The goal of this program is to advance novel concepts that may eventually lead to significant improvements in the clinical outcomes of patients with blood cancer. Grants will support initial exploration of untested but potentially transformative ideas that may radically change the way we treat or understand blood cancer. In addition to applications from blood cancer researchers, we strongly encourage applications from those with expertise outside of blood cancer, with the goal of stimulating new research. In order to receive such an award, applicants must succinctly describe as one aim the innovative idea/approach and a method for testing it within the one year grant period. Grants will be awarded in an amount of up to $75,000 for a one year period. Eligibility Investigators in academic laboratories are eligible to apply. Researchers in any field are encouraged to apply, but the proposal must directly address blood cancer. Investigators must demonstrate that their research environment is equipped and suitable for the proposed study; this includes demonstrated access to patient materials, where applicable. Collaboration between multiple investigators to strengthen the proposed research will be considered favorably, but is not a requirement. Applicants need not be United States (U.S.) citizens nor be associated with a U.S.-based institution. Applicants should hold a Ph.D., M.D., D.V.M. or equivalent degree. Criteria for evaluation Novelty/Innovation: Concept awards are designed to allow initial exploration of new ideas with the potential to open truly new avenues of investigation. Concept awards are not intended to support the logical progression of already established research programs. As such, it is unlikely that a significant amount of preliminary data will exist to support the proposal; however, preliminary data may be included to support the scientific rationale. This is particularly true if the preliminary data shows an unexpected result which then forms the basis of the proposal. Research Strategy and Feasibility The review committee will consider the following: Does the scientific rationale logically support the proposed study, and is it feasible? Is the proposal well-developed, with a clear aim, experimental design, and analysis? Are pitfalls acknowledged? Is it reasonable to expect meaningful results to support or reject the original hypothesis in one year? Impact The proposal must clearly state how the novel idea/approach might ultimately lead to a significant change in the understanding, diagnosis, or treatment of blood cancer.",

"Volunteer of the Year Scholarship We make safe, quality and responsible international volunteer travel genuinely affordable Our volunteers provide assistance to the achievement of long term community goals in countries all over the world Our programs grow cross-cultural awareness and understanding, and foster global citizenship We provide cultural immersion experiences, achieved by living and working with local people, communities, organizations and families International Volunteer HQ provides affordable volunteer programs by partnering with organizations based in each of our program countries. We believe this is the best approach to international volunteering because: Local organizations are in the best position to see where volunteers are genuinely needed. The staff in these organizations are locals, they have been raised in the area and know it inside and out. They can speak the local language, they know the local people and are in the best position to provide guidance, advice, supervision and support to volunteers. Partnering with local organizations reduces the costs associated with hosting volunteers, making programs more affordable. This means more people are enabled to volunteer and that enables greater social outcomes to be achieved. One of the major strengths of IVHQ is our careful selection process in choosing our partner organizations and the high quality volunteer programs that we offer through these partners. Every program that IVHQ offers has been personally inspected by IVHQ. We have experienced the programs first-hand, we have assessed the local teams and we have provided comprehensive IVHQ training to all of our local teams.",academic_level
